# Called by package-macos.sh (SEED_NOTARIZE=1) after the bundle is sealed
# with a Developer ID and BEFORE it is tarred: the updater downloads a tarball,
# and a ticket stapled to a disk image does not travel inside one, so the ticket
# goes on the bundle itself and Gatekeeper can check it with no network at all.
#
# Notarization is not the App Store. It is the other half of Developer ID - the
# arrangement for software distributed outside the store - and involves no
# listing and no review. The credential is nonetheless called an "App Store
# Connect" one. Either form works:
#
#   NOTARY_KEY / NOTARY_KEY_ID / NOTARY_ISSUER_ID       an API key (.p8 contents)
#   NOTARY_APPLE_ID / NOTARY_PASSWORD / NOTARY_TEAM_ID  an app-specific password
