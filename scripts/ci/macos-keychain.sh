# Build a throwaway keychain holding the Developer ID certificate, so that
# `codesign --sign "$CODESIGN_IDENTITY"` works on a runner that has no login
# keychain and no stored identity. Used by the macOS job in
# .github/workflows/build.yml before scripts/package-macos.sh runs.
#
# Environment (all from repository secrets):
#   CODESIGN_IDENTITY     'Developer ID Application: Name (TEAMID)'
#   CERTIFICATE_P12       base64 of the certificate + private key (.p12)
#   CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD  the .p12's password
#
# Why a second certificate exists at all: the one on the maintainer's Mac is
# Xcode's cloud-managed kind, whose private key syncs through iCloud Keychain
# and cannot be exported. A second Developer ID Application certificate under
# the SAME team, issued from a CSR made anywhere, is what CI uses. It is the
# team Nullgate and Commune sign with, so one certificate signs all three.
#
# The keychain is left in place for the rest of the job (package-macos.sh
# signs from it); it lives under $RUNNER_TEMP, which the runner discards.
