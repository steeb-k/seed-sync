# Cross-build the three SEED Sync binaries for Windows on ARM, from an x86_64 host.
#
# The ARM64 build is split across two ABIs, on purpose:
#
#   daemon + CLI -> aarch64-pc-windows-msvc      (no GTK dependency at all)
#   GUI          -> aarch64-pc-windows-gnullvm   (mingw ABI, to match MSYS2's GTK)
#
# The split is forced by GTK: gvsbuild (our x86_64 C:\gtk) is x64-only and vcpkg's gtk
# port explicitly excludes arm64-windows, leaving MSYS2's CLANGARM64 packages as the
# only prebuilt GTK4 + libadwaita for Windows on ARM — and those are mingw-ABI. It
# costs us nothing: the GUI and the daemon are separate processes that only ever meet
# over a named pipe, so no ABI boundary is ever crossed inside a process.
#
# Prereqs:
#   * llvm-mingw (https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/releases, ucrt-x86_64) at
#     C:\llvm-mingw-*  — supplies aarch64-w64-mingw32-{clang,windres} for the GUI.
#   * LLVM/clang on PATH or at C:\Program Files\LLVM — `ring` requires clang to build
#     its aarch64 assembly (this is the one dep that does).
#   * The ARM64 GTK stack + the x86_64 host-tools mirror:
#       pwsh -File scripts\fetch-gtk-msys2.ps1
#       pwsh -File scripts\fetch-gtk-msys2.ps1 -Env ucrt64 -Root C:\gtk-msys2-x64
#   * rustup target add aarch64-pc-windows-msvc aarch64-pc-windows-gnullvm
#   * MSVC ARM64 cross tools + the ARM64 Windows SDK (VS installer:
#     "MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ ARM64/ARM64EC build tools").
#
# Usage:  pwsh -File scripts\build-arm64.ps1 [-GtkRoot C:\gtk-arm64]

#   * msvc pass    -> LLVM's clang, which discovers the MSVC/Windows SDK headers itself.
#     llvm-mingw's clang cannot: it targets mingw and has no idea where assert.h lives,
#     and the build dies with "'assert.h' file not found".
#   * gnullvm pass -> llvm-mingw's clang, which brings its own mingw sysroot.
# So don't collapse these into one PATH — a single ordering breaks one pass or the other.
